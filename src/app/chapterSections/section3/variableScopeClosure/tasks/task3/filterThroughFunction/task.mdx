### Filter through function

We have a built-in method `arr.fitler(f)` if
it returns `true`, then that element is
returned in the resulting array.

Make a set of ready to use filters:

- `inBetween(a, b)` - between `a` and `b` or
  equal to them (inclusively).
- `inArray([...])` - in the given array.
