### Sort by Field

given an array of objects to sort, sort them
by field name using a else verbose function
that looks like this:

```js
Array.sort(byField(fieldname))
```

Instead of doing it the normal way with a
function definition passed as an argument

```js
Array.sort(users.sort((a, b) => (
    a.name > b.name ? 1: -1
    )
))
```
